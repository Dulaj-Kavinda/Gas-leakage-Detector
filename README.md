Gas leakage Detector with SMS alert and sound alarm

Gas leakage problems are often occurring now a days. Since a little hole may step by step develop a hazardous grouping of gas spills are exceptionally perilous. Notwithstanding causing fire and blast perils. Even people lose their homes to fires and explosions caused by gas leaks. Holes can murder vegetation, including huge trees, and may discharge ground, breaking ozone depleting substances to the climate.
So that identifying the gas leakage at correct is essential to avoid these circumstances.

To solve this issue, we have designed the gas leakage detector using Arduino and GSM module with SMS alert and sound alarm. By this, if there is a gas leakage the detector will detect that and sends a sound alarm. And, it will send SMS alerts to saved phone numbers on the sim card.
We have used Arduino Nano Micro controller board, GSM sim 900 Module and MQ6 Gas sensor to implement the prototype.
